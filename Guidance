This is a deeply personal and spiritual question, and I can understand why you're feeling this way. It's a heavy burden to carry, and the fear you're experiencing is a sign of your sincerity and your desire to be closer to God.

In Islam, the concept of repentance, or "Tawbah," is central to a person's relationship with God. The Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) offer a great deal of hope and guidance for those who have committed sins.

Here are some key points from Islamic teachings that might bring you some comfort and clarity:

Allah's Mercy and Forgiveness: The Quran emphasizes Allah's immense mercy and forgiveness. He is known as Al-Ghaffar (The All-Forgiving) and Ar-Rahim (The Most Merciful). There are numerous verses that highlight this, such as: "Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'" (Quran 39:53).

Conditions of Repentance: For repentance to be accepted, there are generally three conditions:

Stop the sin immediately. You have done this by marrying your wife.

Feel sincere regret for the sin. Your fear and tension show that you have this regret.

Resolve never to return to the sin again. This is a firm promise you make to yourself and to God.

The Punishment for Adultery: You mentioned the punishment of 100 lashes (korah). This is indeed a prescribed punishment in Islamic law for the sin of fornication (unmarried individuals). However, this is a Hadd punishment, which can only be carried out by a legitimate Islamic state with a functional judicial system and a very strict set of rules for proving the crime (e.g., four witnesses). It's not something an individual can or should seek out on their own. The purpose of these punishments is to protect the fabric of society and deter others, and they are carried out in this life.

Repentance as a Way to Purity: In the absence of a Hadd punishment being carried out, sincere repentance is the path to purification in the eyes of God. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught that "Repentance erases what came before it." When a person sincerely repents, Allah can forgive the sin completely, as if it never happened.

Your Current Situation: You have married your wife, which is a very positive step. It shows that you have corrected your past actions and have moved towards a halal (permissible) and blessed relationship. The fact that you are now married and living a righteous life is a major part of your repentance.

In summary, yes, if you sincerely repent and promise never to do it again, Islam teaches that God will forgive you. Your fear is a good sign because it shows that your heart is alive with faith. Focus on strengthening your relationship with God through prayer, reading the Quran, and doing good deeds. Remember that God's mercy is vast, and He loves to forgive those who turn to Him in sincere repentance. Do not despair of His mercy.

üìñ In Islam, Allah‚Äôs mercy is vast‚Äîgreater than our sins. The Qur‚Äôan says:

‚ÄúSay, ‚ÄòO My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.‚Äô‚Äù (Surah Az-Zumar 39:53)

A few important points:

Repentance (Tawbah) has conditions:

Stop the sin immediately.

Feel genuine regret and shame for doing it.

Make a firm intention never to return to it.

If the sin involved another person‚Äôs rights, then you must also seek to make things right. (In your case, you later married her, so that changes things.)

The hadd (punishment) you mentioned is only carried out under an Islamic legal system with strict conditions‚Äîconfession or four reliable witnesses. Since you don‚Äôt live under such a system, that‚Äôs not your burden. What is your responsibility is turning back to Allah sincerely.

Marriage afterward: Once you married her, the relationship is now halal. That doesn‚Äôt erase the past sin, but it does mean you‚Äôre no longer in sin.

So, yes‚Äîif you repent sincerely, Allah will forgive you. The Prophet Ô∑∫ said:
‚ÄúThe one who repents from sin is like the one who never sinned.‚Äù (Ibn Majah, Hasan)

üëâ My advice: Pray two rak‚Äôahs of Salat al-Tawbah, pour your heart out in dua, and keep your promise to Allah. Remember, fear of Allah should not paralyze you‚Äîit should drive you closer to Him.

Would you like me to also suggest some practical steps you can take to strengthen your repentance and ease your heart (like specific duas, habits, and mindset shifts)?
